# Penguin Species Classification using Perceptron and Decision Trees

This project focuses on classifying different species of penguins using machine learning models, specifically Perceptron and Decision Trees. The project utilizes the Palmer Penguins dataset, which contains various features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass to distinguish between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing data and normalizes features for better model performance.
- **Perceptron Model:** Trains a perceptron model to classify penguin species based on selected features.
- **Decision Tree Model:** Trains a decision tree model to identify the best split and predict species.
- **Visualization:** Provides scatter plots and decision boundaries for better understanding of model performance.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `binarytree`

You can install the required libraries using:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"
